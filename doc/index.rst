Alarmageddon is a Python monitoring framework for RESTful services, built on top of Requests and Fabric. Alarmageddon supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+

    import alarmageddon
    from alarmageddon.validations.http import HttpValidation
    from alarmageddon.publishing.hipchat import HipChatPublisher

    validations = [HttpValidation.get("http://www.google.com").expect_status_codes([200])]

    publishers = [HipChatPublisher("hipchat.route.here","token","stable","hipchat_room")]
