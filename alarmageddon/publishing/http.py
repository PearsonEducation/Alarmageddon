    """Creates an HTTP Publisher that publishes successes and/or failures
    to either one or two HTTP end points.

    If you want the same URL to be published to whether or not the
    Validation result being published failed or succeeded, please
    supply only the url parameter and omit the failure_url and
    success_url parameters.

    Conversely, if you want different URLs to be requested based on
    whether or not the Validation result being published succeeded,
    please omit the url parameter and supply the success_url and
    failure_url parameters.  The HttpPublisher will use the same
    method, headers, and authentication parameters when requesting
    both of those URLs.  If that is not acceptable, please override
    the relevent getter methods.

    :param url: The URL that this publisher should publish successful and
      failed Validation results to.
    :param success_url: The URL that this publisher should publish successful
      Validation results to.
    :param failure_url: The URL that this publisher should publish failed
      Validation results to.
    :param method: The HTTP method to use when posting.  POST is the default
      because it is the only HTTP method that allows you to send the results
      of the published Validation.  The GET method is allowed but cannot send
      the details of the Validation result along with the request.
    :param headers: headers to send along with the request
    :param auth: if your URLs require authentication you can supply a value
      like the following: ``auth=('user', 'pass')``
    :param attempts: the number of times to try to publish to your URL(s).
    :param retry_after_seconds: how many seconds to wait after a failed
      attempt.
    :param timeout_seconds: how long a single attempt can take before it is
      considered a failed attempt.
    :param publish_successes: specify True if you want this HTTP Publisher to
      publish successful results too.  If you provide a success_url, then
      this HttpPublisher will assume you want to publish successes.
    :param expected_status_code:  the HTTP status code to expect from your
      HTTP server if the Validation result was successfully published.
    :param name: The name of this publisher.
    :param priority_threshold: Will publish validations of this priority or
      higher.
    :param environment: The environment that tests are being run in.
